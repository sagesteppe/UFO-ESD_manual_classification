1,Soil had a lot of calcium carbonate past 24 cm
2,We were only able to dig 55cm deep at this site because we hit bedrock
3,We hit shale at 22cm when digging the soil pit. Soil profiles above the shale were very compacted clay.

Also, plant roots were found down to at least 60 cm.  Johnston Ecological Type: SB1 B"
207,"Lies within St Stony outcrop MUC. Was very difficult to dig soil pit, tried in two locations. The soil pit was going through what looked like weathered bedrock and which makes sense as we are surrounded by rocky outcrops. I got to 40 cm and the texture fit okay within Ruby gravelly sandy loam, but the slope was higher than given in the description of RuE.  No ESD given for RuE, But i would say fits a dry mountain loam profile.
Johnston:GA1 D fits best although some grass species in this description are absent."
