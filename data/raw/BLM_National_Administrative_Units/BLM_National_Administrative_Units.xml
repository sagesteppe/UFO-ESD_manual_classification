			<abstract>Feature level Dataset for the BLM Administrative Unit Boundaries Data Standard. This feature dataset includes both BLM administrative land areas and office locations. Land areas are depicted with polygons for the smallest administrative unit (field offices). Larger administrative units, such as district offices, and administrative states may be derived from these polygons. Office locations at each level are depicted with points.

This dataset is a subset of the official national dataset, containing features and attributes intended for public release and has been optimized for online map service performance. The Implementation Guide represents the official national dataset from which this dataset was derived. </abstract>
			<purpose>This dataset captures and establishes the geographic areas in which the organizational units of the BLM have distinct jurisdictional responsibility for land and resource management activities occurring on the public lands, the maintained rights of the United States (i.e. mineral estate) and actions relating to the Trust responsibilities of the U.S. Government as stipulated in Law or Treaty.  Particularly, this data pertains to the following BLM groups and their purposes: BLM State, District, and Field Office Personnel; most programs and national applications within the BLM; other agencies and the public.</purpose>
			<supplinf>A published revision of the Department Manual’s Part 305: Departmental Science Effects, Chapter 3: Integrity of Scientific and Scholarly Activities (305 DM 3), effective December 16, 2014, is available online at http://elips.doi.gov/ELIPS/DocView.aspx?id=4056. Scholarly information considered in Departmental decision making must be robust, of the highest quality, and the result of as rigorous scientific and scholarly processes as can be achieved. Most importantly, it must be trustworthy. This policy helps us to achieve that standard (http://www.doi.gov/scientificintegrity/index.cfm).

Each state office has a Data Steward or Contact Person for this data. Please contact the specific state office for additional information on their state dataset.</supplinf>

		<logic>This national dataset is an aggregation from multiple datasets provided by the BLM Administrative States, please contact the distributor for additional information on provenance, history, accuracy and quality of the data. The logical consistency of this dataset reflects that of the source datasets. Each source dataset is run through a series of tests to verify that the data complies with the format specified in the Data Standard. ERRORS AND INCONSISTENCIES MAY STILL BE PRESENT IN THE DATA. These tests were conducted using ESRI ArcMap 10.1. The tests consisted of checking coded values for attributes against a domain of accepted values, checking that alpha-numeric values followed a valid format, and checking that numeric values were greater than zero. For the geometry, the topology was validated; however overlaps and gaps can still be found.</logic>
